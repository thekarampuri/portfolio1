    <p class="text-lg mb-6 italic">
      In the heart of Maharashtra, where the monsoon sings and the sun paints gold on fields,
      <br />
      I, Akhil, a 19-year-old dreamer, weave my story in code and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Having completed my diploma in Computer Science and Engineering,
      <br />
      I now stand at the threshold of new beginnings—
      <br />
      Soon to embark on a BTech journey, where ambition meets opportunity.
      <br />
      My days have been filled with algorithms, my nights with the glow of innovation.
      <br />
      Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning call to me—
      <br />
      The poetry of logic, the art of teaching machines to dream.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Frontend development is my canvas, where I paint with pixels and craft with code.
      <br />
      Languages and tools are my brushes, projects my gallery—
      <br />
      Each line a step further in my journey from theory to creation.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      Yet, beyond the circuits and screens, I find joy in the gentle art of storytelling.<br />
      My blog is a collection of moments—snapshots of life, lessons, and laughter.<br />
      And through my lens, photography becomes a silent poem, capturing the world as I see it.
