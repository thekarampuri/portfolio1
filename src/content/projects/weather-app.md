# Historical Weather Patterns Visualizer

This project allows users to explore historical weather data through interactive visualizations. Users can select locations and time periods to see how temperature, precipitation, and other weather metrics have changed over time.

## Features

- Interactive maps showing weather patterns across regions
- Time-series charts for detailed analysis of specific locations
- Comparison tools to contrast different time periods or locations
- Data export functionality for research purposes

## Technical Details

The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript and D3.js for data visualization. Weather data is sourced from public APIs and preprocessed to optimize performance.

The application uses client-side storage to cache frequently accessed data, reducing API calls and improving the user experience.

## Interesting Aspects

One particularly interesting aspect of this project was designing visualizations that could effectively communicate complex patterns while remaining accessible to users without a background in meteorology or data science.

This was achieved through careful attention to color scales, intuitive controls, and progressive disclosure of informationâ€”starting with simple overviews and allowing users to drill down into more detailed data as needed.
