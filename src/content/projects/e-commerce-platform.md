# Vintage Goods E-Commerce Platform

This project is a complete e-commerce solution built for a retailer specializing in vintage and antique goods. The platform needed to handle unique inventory items, detailed product descriptions, and high-quality photography.

## Features

- Product catalog with advanced filtering and search
- Secure checkout process with multiple payment options
- Admin dashboard for inventory management
- Customer accounts with order history
- Responsive design optimized for mobile shopping

## Technical Details

The frontend is built with React, providing a smooth, single-page application experience. The backend uses Node.js with Express, connected to a MongoDB database to store product information, user data, and order details.

Authentication is handled through JWT with role-based access control for customer and administrator accounts.

Images are optimized and served through a CDN to ensure fast loading regardless of the user's location.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was designing a database schema that could accommodate the highly varied nature of vintage products, where each item might have unique attributes not shared by others. The solution was a flexible schema in MongoDB that allowed for common fields across all products while supporting item-specific attributes.

Another challenge was creating an admin interface that made it easy to add detailed descriptions and multiple high-quality images for each product. This was solved by developing a custom content management interface with drag-and-drop functionality and markdown support.
