# Finding Dory

When I was young, I had this peculiar habit of sharpening my crayons with a pencil sharpener. The other kids would look at me with confusion, but I was determined to have the sharpest, most precise crayons in the classroom.

## The Art of Precision

There's something deeply satisfying about a freshly sharpened crayon—the pointed tip, the clean edges, the possibility of fine lines on paper. While other children were content with the rounded, dull tips of their crayons, I sought perfection.

My teacher once asked why I insisted on sharpening my crayons. "Because details matter," I said, without looking up from my drawing of an underwater scene featuring, coincidentally, a blue fish not unlike Dory.

## The Price of Perfection

Of course, there was a cost to this pursuit. Crayons aren't designed to be sharpened like pencils. They would often break, crumble, or melt slightly from the friction of the sharpener. I'd lose a significant portion of each crayon to this process, leaving me with a collection of colorful stubs long before the school year ended.

My parents had to buy me new crayon sets with puzzling frequency, never quite understanding what happened to the previous set so quickly.

## The Metaphor

Looking back, I realize this childhood quirk was an early manifestation of something fundamental about my character—a willingness to sacrifice quantity for quality, to prioritize precision over practicality, to see potential where others saw only what was intended.

In my adult life, I find myself applying this same principle—sometimes appropriately, sometimes to my detriment. There's a lesson in those sharpened crayons about knowing when precision matters and when good enough is, well, good enough.

Sometimes finding your way isn't about having the sharpest tools, but about making the most of what you have. Perhaps that's what Dory would tell us: "Just keep swimming," even if your crayons are dull.
