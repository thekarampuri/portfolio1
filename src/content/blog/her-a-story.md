# Her - A Story

That was the last I saw her.

On a Tuesday afternoon in May, standing at the bus stop with a faded blue duffel bag at her feet. The sun caught in her hair in that way that always made me think of honey. She didn't wave. I didn't stop.

I've replayed that moment in my mind so many times that I'm no longer sure what's memory and what's revision. Did she look sad? Was there a moment of hesitation, a glance in my direction that I missed because I was too focused on maintaining my composure? Or have I added these details later, trying to find meaning in what was perhaps just an ordinary goodbye?

We had known each other for three years, two months, and fourteen days. Not that I was counting—except, evidently, I was. We shared an apartment for most of that time, a collection of mismatched furniture and overlapping routines. Morning coffee made in a French press that she brought from her previous life. Evening conversations that stretched until midnight, then gradually grew shorter as we ran out of new things to say.

The ending wasn't dramatic. There was no betrayal, no irreconcilable difference, no external force that pulled us apart. Just a slow drift, like continents moving imperceptibly over time until one day you look up and realize an ocean has formed between you.

She took the French press when she left. I didn't contest it. It seemed a small thing to surrender in the grand accounting of a relationship's end. Now, each morning, I make coffee in a cheap drip machine, and it tastes different—not worse, just different. Like everything else after someone leaves.

That Tuesday in May was five years ago. Sometimes I wonder if she still uses that French press, if she thinks of our kitchen when she does. More often, I wonder if she remembers me at all, or if I've been reduced to an anecdote, a chapter heading in the story she tells herself about her life.

That was the last I saw her, but not the last I looked for her. In crowds, in coffee shops, in the faces of strangers passing on the street. Always, briefly, before I remember. Before I remind myself that some stories don't have sequels, only endings that you eventually learn to accept.
