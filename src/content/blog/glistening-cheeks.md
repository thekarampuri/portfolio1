# Glistening Cheeks

The drawing hung lopsided on the refrigerator, held by a magnet shaped like a sunflower. A stick figure with an oversized head and a crooked smile. Two blue dots for eyes and red circles on the cheeks—glistening cheeks, she called them.

"Why are they glistening?" I asked my daughter.

"Because she's happy," she said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.

I stood there longer than necessary, coffee growing cold in my hand, considering the simple wisdom in her explanation. Happiness that manifests physically, visibly—glistening on the surface for all to see.

When did I stop showing my happiness so plainly? When did my emotions retreat inward, becoming something to be inferred rather than observed?

The drawing is still there, though my daughter is now old enough to be embarrassed by her early artistic attempts. I keep it as a reminder that there was a time when emotions were simpler, when happiness made cheeks glisten, and when that was enough of an explanation for anything.
