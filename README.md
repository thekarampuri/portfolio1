# Akhil Karampuri – Personal Portfolio & Blog

A modern, traditional-inspired portfolio and blog built with Astro and Tailwind CSS. The homepage features a poetic introduction, a showcase of selected projects (including DataQuery AI Assistant), and links to my blog and photography. The portfolio is now homepage-only for a streamlined experience.
